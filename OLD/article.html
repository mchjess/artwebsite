    <article>
      <p class="lead">A short warm entry that draws the reader in. Use a gentle, conversational sentence here to lower the stakes — an invitation rather than a proclamation.</p>

      <p class="small">This article intentionally varies rhythm using images and typographic shifts. Scrolling should feel like moving through rooms: wide-open moments, narrower paragraphs, visual pauses.</p>

      <div class="full-bleed" aria-hidden="true">
        <img src="./images/full frontal.jpg" alt="Full width scene">
      </div>
<br>
      <p>The first long paragraph: set the scene. Write with sensory detail and small facts. Don't worry about perfection — choose the detail that sings, then continue the line of attention.</p>

      <blockquote class="pull-quote">The street remembered every footstep. I could feel its patience in the seams of the pavement.</blockquote>

      <p>After a pull-quote, break with a short sentence that changes pace. Small sentences create impact. Keep some fragments; rhythm is your friend.</p>

      <div class="media-row">
        <div>
          <img src="./images/fists.jpg" alt="Portrait">
          <div class="caption">Portrait — street series.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="large">An inset paragraph that uses larger type to slow the reader down. Make this reflective — a small idea worth lingering over.</p>
          <p>Follow with a normal paragraph to resume the flow. The contrast between sizes creates visual interest and encourages scanning.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><img class="float-left" src="./images/IMG_2481.jpg" alt="float image">Place an image to the left to allow text to wrap. This creates an intimate relationship between word and picture. Use this for portraits or small details.
    </p>

      <p>Continue the body text. Small anecdotes work well here — observations of how light catches a windowsill, or the sound of bicycle chains. Keep sentences varied: long, short, fragmentary.</p>
      <br>
 <p>Use a small callout to explain context or technique.</p>
 <br>
      <div class="image-grid" aria-hidden="true">
        <img src="./images/testy tree.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="./images/Leiter Painting.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="./images/IMG_2481.jpg" alt="">
      </div>

     
      <div class="callout">Note: these photos were shot on a 35mm camera and scanned at 2400dpi. Grain here is intentional.</div>

      <p>More body text. If a paragraph feels heavy, split it. If a sentence is dull, make it shorter or remove it. The continuous scroll benefits from short, digestible beats.</p>

      <h2>Second Section — Narrower Focus</h2>
      <p>Introduce a new thread: a character, a memory, a detail. Use this section to deepen the essay without repeating earlier material.</p>

      <p class="large">A concluding reflective paragraph in larger type — this slow final paragraph should feel like a place to rest. Make it image-rich in language rather than literal images.</p>
